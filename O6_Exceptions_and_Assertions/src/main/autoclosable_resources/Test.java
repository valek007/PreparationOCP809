		 * Automatic Resource Management: Both FileReader and BufferedReader implement
		 * AutoCloseable, so they will automatically close when the try block completes,
		 * even if an exception is thrown. No Explicit finally: You donâ€™t need a finally
		 * block to close the resources manually; they are automatically closed at the
		 * end of the try block. Exception Handling: If an IOException occurs (e.g., if
		 * the file is not found), the catch block handles it.

		/*
		 * Explanation:
		 * 
		 * Custom AutoCloseable: MyResource is a custom class that implements
		 * AutoCloseable and overrides the close() method. Automatic Closing: The
		 * close() method is called automatically at the end of the try block.

		/*
		 * Explanation:
		 * 
		 * Multiple Resources: FileReader, BufferedReader, and FileWriter are all
		 * managed by a single try-with-resources statement. Automatic Closing Order:
		 * Resources are closed in reverse order of their declaration (FileWriter closes
		 * first, then BufferedReader, then FileReader).

		/*
		 * - Benefits of try-with-resources Automatic Resource Management: 
		 * Ensures resources are closed automatically, reducing boilerplate code.
		 * - Cleaner Code:
		 * No need for explicit finally blocks to close resources. 
		 * - Error Prevention:
		 * Reduces the risk of resource leaks, which can cause memory or file handle exhaustion.
